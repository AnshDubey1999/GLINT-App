Steps to start:
1. Clone the project repository.
2. After switching directories inside, run npm install.
3. Run npm start

This will start running the project on the local host.

4. Install Expo on your device. 
5. Finally, scan the code on the localhost. 

If it doesn't work, switch it to LAN instead of tunnel and scan that code.
